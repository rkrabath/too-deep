Roughly Prioritized List of Things to Implement (RPLoToI)

Refactor
	* Input shouldn't need Display or Dispatch

Implement data files for agents and items (items already started)
	* Agents are granted capabilities based on
		* What they're carrying
		* Where they're standing

Extend dwarf's "desires" so they don't just sit around
    * to drink
    * to work
    * to make new dwarves

wait() for an event, especially if we lose focus.
    Don't continually redraw
